## 🚀 Run the binary

Just download the latest binary from the [release page](https://github.com/seriousm4x/UpSnap/releases) and run it.

**Root**:

```bash
sudo ./upsnap serve --http=0.0.0.0:8090
```

**Non-Root**:

```bash
sudo setcap cap_net_raw=+ep ./upsnap # only once after downloading
./upsnap serve --http=0.0.0.0:8090
```

For more options check `./upsnap --help` or visit [PocketBase documentation](https://pocketbase.io/docs).

If you want to use network discovery, make sure to have `nmap` installed and run UpSnap as root/admin.

## 🐳 Run in docker

You can use the [docker-compose](docker-compose.yml) example. See the comments in the file for customization.

### Non-root docker user:

Create the mount point first:

```bash
mkdir data
```

Then add `user: 1000:1000` to the docker-compose file (or whatever your $UID:$GID is).

### Change port

If you want to change the port from 8090 to something else, change the following (5000 in this case):

```yml
entrypoint: /bin/sh -c "./upsnap serve --http 0.0.0.0:5000"
healthcheck:
  test: curl -fs "http://localhost:5000/api/health" || exit 1
```

### Install additional packages for shutdown cmd

```yml
entrypoint: /bin/sh -c "apk update && apk add --no-cache <YOUR_PACKAGE> && rm -rf /var/cache/apk/* && ./upsnap serve --http 0.0.0.0:8090"
```

You can search for your needed package [here](https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/packages).

### Reverse Proxy

**Caddy example**

```
upsnap.example.com {
    reverse_proxy localhost:8090
}
```

## 🔒 User permissions

UpSnap offers unique access for each user, per device. While admins have all permissions, they can assign specific rights to users such as displaying/hiding a device, accessing device editing, deleting and powering devices on/off. See the last screenshot in the [📸 Screenshots section](#📸-screenshots).

## 🌍 Exposing to the open web

Although UpSnap has user authorisation, it is **not recommended to expose it to the open web** and make it accessible by everyone!

**Reason**: The shutdown device command is basically a command piped to #sh (root if you run docker). If anyone gains unauthorized access and can abuse this api route in any way, the attacker has access to a (root) shell on your local network.

**Recommended**: If you need access from outside your network, please use a vpn. Wireguard or OpenVPN is your way to go.

## 🔧 Help developing
